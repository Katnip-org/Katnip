5ba9f61 2024-12-13 DONE! Else implemented. Gonna release here in a sec. Custom blocks for next tiny update!
92e8506 2024-12-11 technically everything works now. I don't like how else statements work, so I am going to rework that
f6f4a69 2024-12-10 comment fixes
6159a9f 2024-12-08 Added comment support. Added a couple more script tests as well
d791ee2 2024-12-07 fully (ish) functional. Just need to add custom blocks, but then everything is in order
04f9b0a 2024-12-07 Updated commands.txt to contain menus and options (which apparently use their own block with opcode) as well as adding some missing blocks
600debc 2024-12-06 Added {} in commands.txt to denote possible options. This might potentially be used later when making an editor for it. Also fixed some errors in commands.txt found by my validation code 😄
4f48b07 2024-12-06 Added (almost) every single block in scratch to commands.txt to be used. Still working on custom blocks
39db209 2024-12-06 Reorganized code, as well as documenting functions, and added comments. Big commit!!

f94d7cb 2024-12-06 Added projects folder to project (took out of gitignore)
96cb879 2024-12-06 All block types functional. Duplicated blocks fixed. Issue was setting "top of stack" to true for the substack blocks. Still need to add +-/*<> operators though
d82435b 2024-12-05 Mostly functional. Not all blocks added, but all types supported. Weird bug with duplicated substack blocks exists currently.
96bef08 2024-12-04 reporter (at least at depth 2), stack, cap - all are now supported
ab27c15 2024-12-04 Partially functional. Built up interpreter, so it can currently process stack-blocks. Have not tested hat, reporter, c, or cap. I also brough over the "gui" aka turbowarp editor to display the resulting project. I would say that I am 50% of the way to fully functional
d5bd48d 2024-12-04 added .gitignore
6a9fe05 2024-12-04 first commit
